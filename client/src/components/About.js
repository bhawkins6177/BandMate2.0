        Hello all!
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        My name is Brandon and I am a recovering Middle School Music Teacher! This application was made by me to help teachers, leaders,  and musicians keep track of everything they need when running an ensemble. Keep reading if you would like more information.  
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        This application is still under construction, but when it is complete it will offer the following futures.
        <ul>
            <li>Songs and any details about the song you might need to know(instruments, difficulty, writer, ect) </li>
            <li>Information about individual performers including instruments they play, proficiency, and conact information</li>
            <li>Creating sets using performers and songs based on the difficulty and instruments needed for the song </li>
            <li>Anything else I think of along the way!</li>
        </ul>
        If you have any suggestions let me know! I'm open to chat just send me an email at
